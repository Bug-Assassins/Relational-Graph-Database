\end{center}
\vspace{1cm}
Relational Database Management System has been there for quite a few decades. Relational databases are still the most popular means of storing huge amount of data on disk. They are efficient in most cases however in certain types of queries like Join they fail to compute the results efficiently. In recent times, quite a bit of research has been done on Graph Databases - which seems like a promising solution to the bottleneck. Many implementations of such databases have come up - Google's Cayley, Neo4j, etc. However even these graph databases suffer from several overheads.
\par
This project aims at exploring the various ways of using a graph-like storage model for traditional Relational Databases.

\chapter{Introduction}
As the name suggests, graph database model uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. A graph database storage system provides index-free adjacency. This means that every element contains a direct pointer to its adjacent elements and no index lookups are necessary.
\section{Motivation}
Graph Databases seem like a promising model to solve all the problems that exist with the current relational databases. They provide an optimal way to compute the equivalent of the join query in a relational database. Recently there has been increased interest in graphs to represent social networks, web site link structures, and others. Within the field of biology itself, there are many uses for graphs, including metabolic networks, protein-protein interaction networks, chemical structure graphs, gene clusters, and genetic maps. Graphs truly are one of the most useful structures for modeling objects and interactions. However, Graph databases have their own overheads and drawbacks. Sometimes it is very difficult or even impossible to contruct the equivalent relational database from a graph database. Moreover, graph databases don't use SQL and as such it is very difficult for the programmers to realize the query they want to perform. \\
\par
Owing to these reasons, the use of graph databases is currently limited. We were motivated to resolve this problem by taking a middle path between graph and relational databases. We wanted to explore the various ways to optimize the query execution time as well as the storage of the currently popular relational databases. We also wanted to eliminate some sort of data redundancy in a typical relational database system.

\chapter{Literature Review}
Relational Databases are a common choice for primary data storage structure in both academic and commercial pursuits since the 1970s. The Relational Model organizes data into one or more tables of rows and columns, with a unique key for each tuple. Generally, each entity type described in a database has its own table, the tuples representing instances of that entity and the columns representing the attribute values describing each instance. They provide relational operators to manipulate the data in tabular form. Most of the relational databases use SQL as their query language. Relational database systems are generally efficient unless the data contains many relationships requiring joins of large tables. These costly join operations are usually addressed by denormalising data to reduce the number of joins necessary.  
\section{Network Model}
Graph Databases seem like a promising model to solve all the problems that exist with the current relational databases. They provide an optimal way to compute the equivalent of the join query in a relational database. Recently there has been increased interest in graphs to represent social networks, web site link structures, and others.
